# Caption Validation System Guide

## Overview

The Caption Validation System is designed to evaluate the quality of extracted figure and table captions from academic papers. It provides confidence scores for three key quality metrics: semantic clarity, contextual link presence, and completeness. This system enhances plagiarism detection by ensuring that captions are properly validated before being used in similarity comparisons.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Clarity Scoring**: Evaluate semantic clarity and descriptive quality of captions
- **Contextual Link Scoring**: Assess how well captions are referenced in surrounding text
- **Completeness Scoring**: Determine if captions are self-contained and informative
- **Overall Quality Scoring**: Weighted combination of all quality metrics
- **Batch Processing**: Validate multiple captions efficiently
- **Quality Classification**: Categorize captions as high, medium, or low quality

### Quality Metrics

#### 1. Clarity Score (0.0-1.0)
Evaluates the semantic clarity and descriptive quality of captions:
- **Length Assessment**: Captions should be descriptive (minimum 10-20 characters)
- **Generic Term Detection**: Penalizes overly generic captions (e.g., "Figure 1")
- **Descriptive Word Bonus**: Rewards captions with descriptive terms
- **Formatting Quality**: Checks proper capitalization and punctuation
- **Technical Term Recognition**: Identifies domain-specific vocabulary

#### 2. Contextual Link Score (0.0-1.0)
Assesses how well captions are referenced and explained in surrounding text:
- **Label Reference**: Checks if caption label is mentioned in linked text
- **Keyword Overlap**: Calculates semantic similarity between caption and text
- **Reference Patterns**: Identifies proper reference phrases (e.g., "as shown in")
- **Proximity Analysis**: Evaluates text proximity to caption location

#### 3. Completeness Score (0.0-1.0)
Determines if captions are self-contained and provide sufficient information:
- **Subject/Object Presence**: Ensures captions have descriptive content
- **Detail Level**: Assesses the amount of descriptive information
- **Technical Specificity**: Rewards captions with technical details
- **Self-Containment**: Evaluates if caption can stand alone without context

## Use Cases

### 1. Plagiarism Detection Enhancement
Validate caption quality before similarity comparison:

```python
# Example: Validate captions before comparison
captions_to_validate = [
    {
        "caption": "Figure 2: Accuracy across 10 folds (Smith, 2020)",
        "linked_text": "The cross-validation results are shown in Figure 2."
    },
    {
        "caption": "Figure 3: Model performance comparison",
        "linked_text": "As demonstrated in Figure 3, our approach outperforms baselines."
    }
]

validation_results = validate_captions_batch(captions_to_validate)

# Only use high-quality captions for plagiarism detection
high_quality_captions = [
    result['caption'] for result in validation_results 
    if result['validation_status'] == 'high_quality'
]
```

### 2. Content Quality Assessment
Evaluate the overall quality of academic papers:

```python
# Example: Assess paper quality based on caption quality
paper_captions = [
    # ... extracted captions from paper
]

validation_results = validate_captions_batch(paper_captions)

# Calculate paper quality score
total_captions = len(validation_results)
high_quality_ratio = sum(1 for r in validation_results if r['validation_status'] == 'high_quality') / total_captions

if high_quality_ratio >= 0.8:
    print("High-quality paper with well-captioned figures/tables")
elif high_quality_ratio >= 0.6:
    print("Medium-quality paper with acceptable captions")
else:
    print("Low-quality paper with poor caption quality")
```

### 3. Automated Quality Control
Filter out low-quality captions in automated processing:

```python
# Example: Quality control in automated processing
def process_paper_captions(paper_text):
    # Extract captions
    captions = extract_captions_from_text(paper_text)
    
    # Validate quality
    validation_results = validate_captions_batch(captions)
    
    # Filter by quality threshold
    quality_threshold = 0.7
    valid_captions = [
        result['caption'] for result in validation_results
        if result['quality_scores']['overall_quality_score'] >= quality_threshold
    ]
    
    return valid_captions
```

## Quality Scoring Examples

### High Quality Caption
```json
{
    "caption": "Figure 4: Performance comparison of deep learning models across multiple datasets",
    "linked_text": "As illustrated in Figure 4, our proposed model achieves superior performance compared to baseline approaches.",
    "quality_scores": {
        "clarity_score": 0.95,
        "contextual_link_score": 0.98,
        "completeness_score": 0.92,
        "overall_quality_score": 0.95
    },
    "validation_status": "high_quality"
}
```

### Medium Quality Caption
```json
{
    "caption": "Table 2: Results summary",
    "linked_text": "The results are summarized in Table 2.",
    "quality_scores": {
        "clarity_score": 0.7,
        "contextual_link_score": 0.8,
        "completeness_score": 0.6,
        "overall_quality_score": 0.71
    },
    "validation_status": "medium_quality"
}
```

### Low Quality Caption
```json
{
    "caption": "Fig",
    "linked_text": "See figure above.",
    "quality_scores": {
        "clarity_score": 0.2,
        "contextual_link_score": 0.3,
        "completeness_score": 0.1,
        "overall_quality_score": 0.21
    },
    "validation_status": "low_quality"
}
```

## Performance Metrics

```

## Integration with Plagiarism Detection

### Workflow
1. **Extract Captions**: Extract figure/table captions from papers
2. **Validate Quality**: Apply quality validation to all captions
3. **Filter by Quality**: Use only high-quality captions for comparison
4. **Normalize Captions**: Apply normalization for fingerprinting
5. **Calculate Similarity**: Compare normalized, validated captions
6. **Generate Report**: Include quality scores in plagiarism report

### Quality Thresholds
- **High Quality**: Overall score ≥ 0.8 (recommended for strict comparison)
- **Medium Quality**: Overall score 0.6-0.8 (acceptable for general comparison)
- **Low Quality**: Overall score < 0.6 (exclude from comparison)

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE validated_captions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    original_caption TEXT NOT NULL,
    linked_text TEXT,
    clarity_score DECIMAL(3,3),
    contextual_link_score DECIMAL(3,3),
    completeness_score DECIMAL(3,3),
    overall_quality_score DECIMAL(3,3),
    validation_status VARCHAR(20),
    paper_id INTEGER REFERENCES papers(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Quality Threshold Selection
- **Strict Plagiarism Detection**: Use threshold 0.8+ for high precision
- **General Content Analysis**: Use threshold 0.6+ for balanced approach
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Use threshold 0.4+ for maximum recall

### 2. Batch Processing
- Process captions in batches for efficiency
- Use appropriate batch sizes (50-100 captions)
- Monitor quality score distributions

### 3. Quality Monitoring
- Track quality score trends over time
- Alert on papers with consistently low-quality captions
- Use quality scores for content ranking

### 4. Integration Strategy
- Validate captions before normalization
- Include quality scores in similarity calculations
- Use quality-weighted similarity scores

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Low Clarity Scores
- **Cause**: Captions are too short or generic
- **Solution**: Ensure captions are descriptive and specific

#### 2. Low Contextual Link Scores
- **Cause**: Captions are not properly referenced in text
- **Solution**: Check for proper figure/table references

#### 3. Low Completeness Scores
- **Cause**: Captions lack descriptive content
- **Solution**: Add more detail to captions

#### 4. API Errors
- **Cause**: Invalid JSON or missing fields
- **Solution**: Validate input format and required fields

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging for detailed processing information:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
