# Image Description Guessing System

## Overview

The Image Description Guessing System is an advanced AI-powered feature that intelligently generates descriptions for figure and table images when explicit captions are missing from OCR-extracted research papers. This functionality is crucial for completing the content analysis and enabling effective plagiarism detection when visual elements lack proper descriptions.

## Features

### üîç **Automatic Placeholder Detection**
- Identifies image placeholders in OCR text (image_001.jpg, fig_002.png, etc.)
- Supports multiple file formats (jpg, jpeg, png, gif, bmp)
- Handles various naming conventions (image_, fig_, table_, img_, etc.)
- Detects both figure and table placeholders

### üß† **Intelligent Context Analysis**
- **Nearby Text Analysis**: Examines text surrounding image placeholders
- **Document Context**: Considers overall document content and structure
- **Academic Language**: Understands research terminology and concepts
- **Content Relationships**: Identifies connections between text and visual elements

### ü§ñ **AI-Powered Description Generation**
- Uses Groq LLM for intelligent caption generation
- Combines multiple analysis techniques for accuracy
- Provides confidence scores for generated descriptions
- Handles complex academic content and terminology

## How It Works

### 1. Placeholder Extraction
```python
def extract_image_placeholders_from_text(text: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Extract image placeholder references from OCR text.
    """
    # Identifies patterns like:
    # - "image_001.jpg"
    # - "fig_002.png"
    # - "table_003.jpeg"
    # - "img_004.gif"
```

### 2. Context Analysis
```python
def find_nearby_text_for_placeholder(placeholder: str, text: str, context_window: int = 200):
    """
    Find text snippets near an image placeholder reference.
    """
    # Analyzes:
    # - Sentences containing the placeholder
    # - Surrounding context (2-3 sentences)
    # - Relevant academic content
```

### 3. AI Description Generation
```python
def analyze_image_context_with_ai(placeholder: str, nearby_text: List[str], full_text: str):
    """
    Use AI to analyze context and suggest a caption for the image placeholder.
    """
    # AI analyzes:
    # - Content type and purpose
    # - Academic context and terminology
    # - Visual element function
    # - Research methodology relevance
```
