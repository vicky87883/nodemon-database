# Caption-to-Paragraph Matching System

## Overview

The Caption-to-Paragraph Matching System is an advanced feature that automatically identifies and matches figure and table captions with their corresponding descriptive paragraphs in research papers. This functionality is crucial for plagiarism detection and content analysis, as it helps understand how visual elements are referenced and described in academic documents.

## Features

### 🔍 **Automatic Caption Extraction**
- Identifies figure captions (Figure 1, Fig. 2, etc.)
- Identifies table captions (Table 1, Tbl. 2, etc.)
- Supports multiple caption formats and variations
- Handles both numbered and informal references

### 🎯 **Intelligent Paragraph Matching**
- **Proximity Analysis**: Finds paragraphs near the caption location
- **Keyword Matching**: Identifies paragraphs with similar terminology
- **Semantic Similarity**: Uses AI to understand content relationships
- **Reference Detection**: Finds explicit mentions of figure/table labels

### 🤖 **AI-Powered Enhancement**
- Uses Groq LLM for intelligent content analysis
- Combines traditional algorithms with AI insights
- Provides confidence scores for each match
- Handles complex academic language and terminology

## How It Works

### 1. Caption Extraction
```python
def extract_captions_from_text(text: str) -> Tuple[List[Dict], List[Dict]]:
    """
    Extract figure and table captions from research paper text.
    """
    # Identifies patterns like:
    # - "Figure 1: System architecture"
    # - "Fig. 2. Model performance"
    # - "Table 1: Comparison results"
    # - "Tbl. 2. Experimental data"
```

### 2. Paragraph Analysis
```python
def find_matching_paragraphs_for_caption(caption_text: str, caption_label: str, full_text: str, caption_line: int):
    """
    Find paragraphs that match or refer to a given caption.
    """
    # Analyzes:
    # - Proximity to caption location
    # - Keyword overlap
    # - Semantic similarity
    # - Explicit references
```

### 3. AI Enhancement
```python
def analyze_caption_with_ai(caption_text: str, caption_label: str, matching_paragraphs: List[str], full_text: str):
    """
    Use AI to analyze caption and find the best matching paragraphs.
    """
    # AI analyzes:
    # - Content relationships
    # - Academic context
    # - Descriptive quality
    # - Relevance scoring
```

r'^Fig\.?\s*(\d+)[:.\s]+(.+)$'
r'^Fig\s+(\d+)[:.\s]+(.+)$'
r'^FIGURE\s+(\d+)[:.\s]+(.+)$'

# Table patterns
r'^Table\s+(\d+)[:.\s]+(.+)$'
r'^Tbl\.?\s*(\d+)[:.\s]+(.+)$'
r'^TABLE\s+(\d+)[:.\s]+(.+)$'
```

    caption_similarity = calculate_semantic_similarity(
        match1.caption_text, match2.caption_text
    )
    
    # Compare matching paragraphs
    paragraph_similarities = []
    for p1 in match1.matching_paragraphs:
        for p2 in match2.matching_paragraphs:
            similarity = calculate_semantic_similarity(p1, p2)
            paragraph_similarities.append(similarity)
    
    # Calculate overall similarity
    avg_paragraph_similarity = sum(paragraph_similarities) / len(paragraph_similarities) if paragraph_similarities else 0.0
    
    return (caption_similarity + avg_paragraph_similarity) / 2
